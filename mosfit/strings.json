    "want_more_walkers": "Warning: While emcee accepts a number of walkers that is  twice the number of dimensions or greater, simple tests  with toy problems show poor convergence with this minimum.  We suggest using at least 10x the number of dimensions (`-N {}` suggested for this fit), and preferably more, if  feasible."
